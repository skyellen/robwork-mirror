This is the RAPID collision detection package.

Just type "make" in this directory to compile the package
and the test program.

The library will be compiled into 

	libRAPID.a

The only include file you need in your client
application is 

	RAPID.H

The sample client application, which will be built
in this directory is,

	sample_client

Run this program, and look over its source code 
(in sample_client.C) to get a feel for how to use RAPID.

A simple text user manual can be found in

	doc/user_manual.txt
