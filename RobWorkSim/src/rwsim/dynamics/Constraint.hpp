 * @brief A constraint is a mathematical model that constrain the movement
 * between two arbitrary bodies in a dynamic simulation.
 *
 * For a device the Link and Joint types should be used to specify the constraints.
 *
 * The Constraint type can however be used between any two bodies. For instance between two
 * free bodies, or between a free body and a link of a device.
 *
 * All functions in this class are thread-safe. Only the transform of the constraint and the spring
 * parameters can be changed after creation of the constraint.
