Katana Native Interface (KNI) - Brief Install Guide
===================================================
(c) 2004 Neuronics AG


There is no setup-/install-program. Just copy the complete folder
to a location on your harddisk. There is no need to compile anything:
The library and the demo-programs are already compiled for Win32 and Linux.
If you want to re-compile a part of the KNI or the whole package, just
keep reading this guide.

For building your own projects, you only need the header-files "KNIHeaders"
and the library:
- libKNIBase.lib for statical linking on win32
- KNIBase.lib and KNIBase.dll for dynamic linking on win32
- libKNIBase.a (statically-linked linux) or
- libKNIBase.X.Y.Z.W.so (dynamically-linked linux).

The demo-programs are per default all statical linked. On Windows (VS.NET 03) you
can have the demo-programs linked against the DLL by selecting the "Release (DLL)" profile.


Win32
-----
Variant 1 (Visual Studio .NET needs to be installed)
1. Open the file "KNI.sln"
2a. You can compile the package by right-clicking on 'Projectmap "KNI" (5 Projects)' -> "Rebuild Projectmap"
2b. For just compiling a specific part, right-click on a sub-project -> "Rebuild"

NOTE for Borland Users: Since the Borland IDE can't work with libKNIBaselib, please use the DLL or contact us
for source code and/or support.

Linux
-----
(make and the gcc-compiler-suite have to be installed)
1. change to "KatanaNativeInterface" by 'cd YOUR_INSTALL_DIR/KatanaNativeInterface'
2a. type 'make'
    this compiles everything (works only if you have the source-code of the library)
2b. type 'make libs' or 'make demos' to compile either the library (if you have the source-code) or the demo-programs.
2c. for building a specific demo, please change to the appropriate directory and type 'make'


General Note
------------
Usually the source-code of the KNI library isn't supplied. Please contact our customer support or
the softdev-Team if you think you need it for a specific project or if you experience some compatibility
problems with your current Operating System.

Linux Note
----------
The plain 'make' command may fail if there are no source-files for the library. Just use the command
'make demos' to compile the demo-programs.
Please check the Makefiles for further options.
