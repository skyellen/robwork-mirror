Overview:
=========

This is the README file of the vcc directory of the SDHLibrary-CPP.
It contains the project file for the Visual Studio environment to
build a library that your own projects can be linked against.

The file SDHLibrary.vcproj contains the project definitions needed
by Visual Studio. Please open this file from within Visual Studio
or doubleclick it in an explorer. (Of course you must have Visual
Studio installed to to this)
