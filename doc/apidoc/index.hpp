\section sec_index_intro Introduction

\b RobWork is a collection of C++ libraries for simulation and control
of robot systems. RobWork is used for research and education as well
as for practical robot applications. Features of the library include:

- Kinematic modeling of various types of industrial manipulators.

- Path-planning and inverse kinematics algorithms.

- Simulation of sensors

- Task and trajectory representations

Besides the core part RobWork has a number of add-ons including

- RobWorkStudio which provides a graphical user interface

- RobWorkSim which is a simulator suited for grasping.
.
Target audience of RobWork is:
- Researchers who needs a common framework for experimental robotics
- Students who wants to experiment with concepts of robotics
- Implementers of robot applications


RobWork is developed at the <a
href="http://www.mip.sdu.dk/robotics">robotics department</a> of the
<a href="http://www.sdu.dk/mmmi">Maersk McKinney Moller Institute</a>
at the <a href="http://www.sdu.dk">University of Southern
Denmark</a>. The focus of the department is on industrial robots and
their applications.
