    StateConstraint, QConstraint, StopCriteria.

  - Automatic exclusion of statically linked frames in the collision
    detector.

  - A Ptr<T> convention for passing of pointers to objects.

  - Path planners can now be aborted by a stop criteria.

  - A Models utilities file.

    not a reference).

2008-6-4:

  - ProximityStrategy::clearFrame() now required on the interface.

  - New methods CollisionDetector::setCollisionStrategy() and
    CollisionDetector::getCollisionStrategy().

  - Use RW_REMOVE_DEPRECATED to remove all deprecated methods.

2008-4-25: The interface of MetricUtil has been rewritten.

2008-4-23: Frame::getDof() is deprecated; use getDOF() like for
Device.
