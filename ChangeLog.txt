2008-3-12 (lpe)
  - Updated RWXMLLoader to support Cylinders
  
2008-11-18 (lpe)
  - Removed old stuff marked as deprecated. This was mainly old static method written in 
    upper-case and a new other method ealier renamed. Unless explicitly having specified to use
    deprecated methods this does not change anything.

2008-11-17 (lpe)
  - Replaced the use of auto_ptr with rw::common::Ptr to support GCC 4.3 and corrected include's 
    also to support GCC 4.3.

  - The XML parser now adds DHparameters (DHSet) as properties to joints that 
    are specified with dhparameters.

    instance.

2008-10-3 (alauo):

  - An implementation of Stefano Carpins ARW path planner.

2008-09-22 (alauo):

2008-7-30 (alauo):

  - "Manhattan" is the correct spelling.

  - Metric<T> is now a metric on T and not a metric on
    boost::numeric::ublas::vector<T>. QMetric is a typedef for
    Metric<Q>. Use MetricFactory to construct your QMetric values.

2008-7-23 (alauo):

  - New path planner class: PlannerConstraint.

2008-7-22 (alauo):

  - New Models::getStatePath() utility functions.

2008-7-22 (alauo):

  - New or renamed path planner classes: QExpand, QEdgeConstraint,
    QToTPlanner, QToQPlanner, QToQSamplerPlanner.

  - Removal of deprecated or non-maintained classes:
    StraightLinePathPlanner, lazyprm.

  - CollisionDetector takes Ptr types as argument in the constructor.

2008-7-1 (alauo):

  - XML::printTree() utility.

  - "Smart" default collision setup removed from TUL loader.

2008-6-24 (alauo):

  - Bugfix for the TUL loader: The initial state for movable frames was
  not set.

  - New SBL path planner.

  - Abstractions for path planners: QSampler, QNormalizer,
    StateConstraint, QConstraint, StopCriteria.

  - Automatic exclusion of statically linked frames in the collision
    detector.

  - A Ptr<T> convention for passing of pointers to objects.

  - Path planners can now be aborted by a stop criteria.

  - A Models utilities file.

2008-6-8 (alauo):

  - Image takes a pointer to vector<unsigned char> as argument (and
    not a reference).

2008-6-4 (alauo):

  - ProximityStrategy::clearFrame() now required on the interface.

  - New methods CollisionDetector::setCollisionStrategy() and
    CollisionDetector::getCollisionStrategy().
    CollisionDetector::setCDStrategy() is now deprecated.

  - New methods Q::empty(), Transform3D(translation),
    Transform3D(rotation).

2008-4-28 (alauo):

  - The TUL loader now supports multiple identifiers for collision
    models and drawables.

2008-4-28 (alauo):

  - Static methods now start with a lower case letter. Many of the
    upper case methods have been removed, but the most frequently
    used have been declared deprecated.

  - Use RW_REMOVE_DEPRECATED to remove all deprecated methods.

2008-4-25 (alauo): The interface of MetricUtil has been rewritten.

2008-4-23 (alauo): Frame::getDof() is deprecated; use getDOF() like for
Device.

2008-4-23 (alauo): Rewrite and cleanup of rw::task.

2008-4-23 (alauo): Transform2D, Rotation2D and Vector2D should now be of the
same standard as the 3D classes.
