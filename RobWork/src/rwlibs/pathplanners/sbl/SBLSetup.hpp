       @brief Common parameters for SBL based planners.

       All versions of the SBL planner base verify configurations and paths in
       the configuration space using a PlannerConstraint object.

       In addition, parameters can given to define how expansion around a node
       of the tree should be done and under what circumstances the two trees
       should be connected.

       A SBLSetup object stores pointers to the shared objects, but can be
       copied and assigned freely.

           The SBL planner for this setup performs brute force search for the
           nearest neighbor of the other tree, and attempts to connect the trees

           The nodes returned by the expansion strategy must be collision free
           or empty. If an empty configuration is returned, the planner tries to
           expand somewhere else.

           @brief Constructor

           Simple default expansion and tree connection strategies are chosed
           based on the device for which the planning is done.

           The planner expands uniformly at random with a maximum stepsize of \b
           expandRadius relative to the diameter of the configuration space. The
           step size and the diameter is measured by the infinity metric.

           The planner connect a newly created node to the nearest node of the
           other tree if the distance to the other node (measured by the
           infinity metric and relative to the diameter of the configuration
           space) is less than \b connectRadius.

           If \b expandRadius or \b connectRadius is negative, a default value
           is chosen.

           @param constraint [in] Planning constraint.

           @param device [in] Device for which planning is done.

           @param expandRadius [in] Node expansion radius.
