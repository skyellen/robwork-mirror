           Based on \b device, a default distance metric and expansion strategy
           is chosen. A connection to a goal node is attempted if the distance
           is below \b nearDistance. A variance based expansion method is chosen

           @param nearDistance [in] Try to connect to the goal if the distance
           to the goal measured by \b metric is below this threshold. If \b
           metric is null, a default value for \b nearDistance is chosen.

           @param historySize [in] Number of previous configurations on the path
           to include in computation of the next expand step. If \b historySize
           is negative, a default value for the parameter is chosen.
