    /**
       @brief A device constructed from a sequence of devices.

       The configuration of a composite device is equal to the concatenation of
       the configurations of the sequence of devices.

       The devices that make up the CompositeDevice may not share joints, but
       the implementation does not check if this is actually the case.

       A composite device implements its operations of Device by querying each
       Joint in the straight-forward way of JointDevice. The notable
       exception is Device::setQ() which is implemented by forwarding the
       Device::setQ() calls to the sequence of devices. This means that
       CompositeDevice works also for example for devices of type ParallelDevice
       that have an overwritten implementation of Device::setQ().

       The devices from which the composite device is constructed must all be of
       type JointDevice. An exception is thrown by the constructor if one of
       the devices is not of this subtype.

       The computation of Jacobians of CompositeDevice is not correct in
       general, but is correct only for devices for which the standard technique
       of JointDevice is correct. We cannot in general in RobWork do any
       better currently. The implementation does not check if the requirements
       for the computation of Jacobians are indeed satisfied.

       CompositeDevice is related to TreeDevice in the sense that
       CompositeDevice has also multiple end-effectors (one end-effector for
       each device). CompositeDevice differs from TreeDevice by not requiring
       that the child-to-parent paths of the end-effectors connect to a common
       base.
