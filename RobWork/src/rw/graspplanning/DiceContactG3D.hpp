/**
 * @brief generates candidate contact point sets (contact grasps) for
 * grasping a given object. The nr of contacts per grasp is given by the user
 * and a set of possibly good contact grasps are generated.
 *
 *  The method used is that which is used in the article
 *  "Grasping the Dice by Dicing the Grasp" by Ch. Borst, M. Fisher and
 *  G. Hirzinger
 *
 *  It works by randomly selecting surface contact grasps that are filtered using a
 *  fast but conservative force closure filter.
 *  As such grasps produced is not strictly force closure. Which means
 *  that another filter must also be applied before using the actual grasp.
 *
 * @note (TODO) the sampling of contacts on the surface is not uniform on the surface area
 * but instead in the number of triangles. To enable good sampling the triangles of the
 * geometry should not vary too much in size.
