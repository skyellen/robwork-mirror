/**
 * @brief Template class form which to inherit when creating a factory for a plugin.
 *
 * Example: If we wish to create a new type of rw::models::Device the following steps are needed.
 * 1) Implement you device "MyDevice" which should inherit from rw::models::Device.

 * 2) Create a Factory (lets call it MyDeviceFactory) which inherits from PluginFactory<T> and 
 * specifies T=rw::models::Device. It is important to specify T=rw::models::Device and NOT MyDevice
 * as the PluginRepository can otherwise not identify it as a factory for creating a device.
 *
 * 3) Override the relevant "make" methods from PluginFactory<T> to provide a way of creating instances
 * of MyDevice. Which methods to override depends on how and where you wish to use your plugin. See the
 * documentation of the different methods.
 *
 * 4) Call DLL_FACTORY_METHOD(MyDeviceFactory) to create a proper entry in the dynamic library. Make sure 
 * that MyDeviceFactory has a default constructor.
